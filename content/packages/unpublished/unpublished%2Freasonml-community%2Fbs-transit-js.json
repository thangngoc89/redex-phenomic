Feels like a shame to lose all that information & type everything as js objects.\nSince transit provides a way to encode/decode custom data, it seemed like\na good fit for encoding ml types. If this thing works out, I'll look into automating\neverything with ppx.\n\nHead over to `src/example.re` to get up & running ASAP.\n","analyzed":"2017-12-24T16:47:08.126Z","updated":"2017-12-24T16:47:08.126Z","stars":7,"score":0,"quality":0,"popularity":0,"maintenance":0,"homepageUrl":"https://github.com/BuckleTypes/bs-transit-js","repositoryUrl":"https://github.com/reasonml-community/bs-transit-js","npmUrl":null,"docsUrl":null}
